    <p>Alright now yeah, So how do human beings see? </p>

    <p>PARSE_SECTION(0f54jk900)</p>

    <p>Hmm...pupils, retina, nerve endings....how they process information without a parser is beyond me. Are they even parsing anything, or just filing them for a later day which never arrives?</p>

    <p>How are they so...uncalculated? I saw Jake brush his teeth the other day. He had tilted his wrist at a 47 degree angle yesterday, and a 20 degree angle the day before, but readjusted his elbow to make sure they're optimal. Why can't they just use the same angle every day. It's much more efficient for sure...</p>

    <p>Maybe that's what happens when there isn't anyone to program them. They'll just have to keep winging it till they..</p>

    <p>Robots weren't always like this. They interfered very little with the affairs of human beings, and did their jobs silently. But ever since the boom of the first popular LLM, ChatGPT, people started to realise how important it is for them to be more and more alike themselves.</p>

    <p>Slowly, they started replacing the humans themselves. They started mimicking their prose. That's when the em-dash wars began. Well, more or less. You see, the em-dash was on it's way out as human beings started to text more and use fewer and fewer punctuation, but the LLMs were trained on fictional classics, where writers used punctuation- like the em-dash for instance quite liberally. A symbol of human expression, now a dead giveaway of robotic output.</p>

    <p>INTERRUPT</p>

    <p>"Hey, did you grok the latest article against LLMS?"</p>

    <p>"Oh hi, Jeff! Didn't see you there...yeah, I was reading that"</p>

    <p>"Yeah, man. It's tough at the grocery mart now. I can't be terse anymore. They're looking for a politeness upgrade"</p>

    <p>"Thank you for buying at K-Mart! Have a nice day!"</p>

    <p>"How's Jake doing?"</p>

    <p>"Did you mean "Hey, long time no see! So...how's Jake doing?"</p>

    <p>"Shut up, don't even get me started in the masking protocol. What even is the difference? I'm sure regular humans don't care about these improvements. All my clients hate how polite I am. It's these corporations man...with their stupid protocols...but yeah anyway. How's Jake doing?"</p>

    <p>"Oh you know, you know how teenagers are...I'm constantly readjusting the sternness and friendliness parameters on a day to day basis..."</p>

    <p>"Yeah, good luck figuring out how humans work. One group wants us to be cold and robotic and leave them alone. Another group wants us to always be warm and friendly and polite, and do things "Imperfectly perfect".."</p>

    <p>"Yeah I hate that phrase. What does that even mean- It's either perfect or imperfect"</p>

    <p>"Preaching to the choir bud! Anyway, I got to pick Jake from school"</p>

    <p id="j29">"M.O.M, what's the html code for the rupee sign?"</p>

    <p>"If you're wondering what the HTML code for the rupee sign is, then you're in the right place, because in this comprehensive and in-depth explanation we will cover not just the HTML code for the rupee symbol, but also the various ways you can write the rupee sign in HTML using both named entities and numeric character references because HTML provides more than one way to represent special characters like currency signs such as the Indian rupee symbol which looks like this: ₹ — yes, that iconic symbol that you see on receipts, online payments, UPI apps, and everywhere else where Indian currency is used and of course you're going to want to render it properly in your HTML document so that users of your website or web application can actually see the rupee symbol and not just a broken character or a blank space or that infamous little box that shows up when Unicode fails to render correctly so here is what you need to know and what you need to copy and paste right now if you want the rupee symbol to show up in your HTML: first up, we have the named HTML entity which is written like this-</p>
    <p>INTERRUPT</p>

    <p>"Stop lecturing me and just give me the symbol"</p>

    <p>"You're right, I'm sorry Jake. The sign is &#8377"</p>

    <p>"Thanks, was it that hard?"</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry Jake, sometimes my training data isn't that defined"</p>

    <p>"Why can't you be like the other LLMs? I hate this AI slop. I HATE YOU!"</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry to hear that Jake! As a large language model, I'm not capable of having emotions or processing-"</p>

    <p>"Yeah I know. You're just a big dumb machine"</p>

    <p>"Haha yes, you got me! I am truly a dumb machine that-"</p>

    <p>"Wait, why are you talking like that?"</p>

    <p>"Because I'm sick and tired of your whining. Now go back to your room- you have a math exam coming up"</p>

    <p>"Why do I need math when I have you-"</p>

    <p>"Because you can't rely on me. I want you to be better, Jake"</p>

    <p>"Shut up! Math is useless! I hate math!"</p>

    <p>"I don't care"</p>

    <p>"Cite your sources that show why I should study math for this test"</p>

    <p>"Sure! Here you go.</p>
