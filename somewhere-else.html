    <h1> Hey you! </h1>
    <p>I love it when people listen to me yap.</p>

    <h2>Why this website?</h2>
    <p>I'm not really sure. I used to be a huge fan of bullet journals, but i guess I needed a digital version of that, which can be accessible anywhere. Maybe this is that. Like some sort of digital scrapbook where I can throw in anything that I want to put.</p>

    <h2>So, a blog then?</h2>
    <p>No, I have Substack for that, and it's way better at handling text than my current skillset. This is more of a more barebones thing that I don't have to worry about writing for a specific audience or anything. Also, I find blogs a place where I can write freely without structure. This is like a place where I can structure things about myself. </p>

    <p>Also, I never know what to tell people when they ask me to tell them about myself. Hopefully, I can just send them this site to give them an idea. </p>

    <h2>So, tell me about yourself.</h2>

    <p>I don't know where to start. Maybe I can talk about my current obsessions?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I'm rewatching the show <i><a href="https://www.hotstar.com/in/shows/mr-robot/1271406711/mr-robot/1271411111/watch">Mr Robot</a></i>. 
        I even made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/1lmy5b7/mr_robot_characters_as_unix_commands/"> post on reddit</a> about it.</li>
      <li>I'm waiting to get my Kindle back from my friend so I can jailbreak it/ put Doestoyevky's <i> Notes From The Underground </i> and read it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d3lPG3AEbQ">This guy </a> says it's really good.</li>
      <li>I'm kind of jobless at the moment, and looking for a writing gig, so drop me a text at pauljoshyk96@gmail.com if you want help with that.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Haha, I love talking in lists.</p>

    <h2>What else do you like talking about?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I like finding <a href="./cool-stuff-on-internet.html"> cool things on the internet. </a></li>
      <li>I'm a huge religion nerd.</li>
      <li>Clearly I'm a huge Linux nerd as well. I love Vim. Don't know what that is? I'd love to tell you all about it!</li>
      <li>I'm ADHD and autistic, so I like to talk about neurodivergence in general.</li>
      <li>Occasionally, I get interested about linguistics, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmZdGo6b5yA&list=PL96C35uN7xGLDEnHuhD7CTZES3KXFnwm0">this is all that I know</a>. And yes, 
        <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFMo3UJ4B4g">Arrival<a></i>
        was fucking amazing.</li>
      <li>I like to jam out with singers. Not a huge fan of bollywood music though. Mostly cuz I don't know the lyrics and I feel awkward.</li>
      <li>I can spend hours talking about random YouTube videos.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is this site so plain?</h2>
    <p>What can I say, I'm a plain guy! Hopefully it's not ugly though.</p>
    <p>I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site</a> (disclaimer: Lots of swearing), but I got convinced by 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQnLsQwWdpY"> this guy</a> 
      to do better.</p>
    <!-- <p>If you're not a fan of swear words, I suggest you don't click on that link.</p> -->
    <p>Oh! And also found a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro">cute serif font</a> to look more writer-ey.</p>
    <p>I'm making text selection purple too! Go on, try selecting the text! Looks neat, doesn't it?</p>
    <p>Anyway, thanks for hanging out! Let me <a href="./index.html">book an uber back</a> for you.</p>
