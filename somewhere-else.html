    <h1> Hey you! </h1>
    <p>I love it when people listen to me yap.</p>

    <h2>Why this website?</h2>
    <p>You don't like beating around the bush, do you?</p>

    <p>So I used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfRf43JTqY4">bullet journal</a>, a lot, but it had a lot of issues.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I keep forgetting about them.</li>
        <li>I hate correcting things.</li>
        <li>My hands starts cramping when I write for too long.</li>
        <li>I can't show that to other people, because of privacy reasons.</li>
      </ul>
      
    <p>I needed a digital solution that felt like paper. Clicking on buttons don't. Writing in HTML comes very close. </p>

    <h2>So, a blog then?</h2>
    <p>No, I have <a href="https://paulineprinciples.substack.com/">Substack</a> for that, and that's way better at handling my ramblings, and comments, and images and all that. This is more of a scratchpad where I can try out different ways to organise my stuff. </p>

    <h2>Tell me more about yourself then.</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I'm rewatching the show <i><a href="https://www.hotstar.com/in/shows/mr-robot/1271406711/mr-robot/1271411111/watch">Mr Robot</a></i>. 
        I even made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/1lmy5b7/mr_robot_characters_as_unix_commands/"> post on reddit</a> about it.</li>
      <li>I'm waiting to get my Kindle back from my friend so I can jailbreak it/ put Doestoyevky's <i> Notes From The Underground </i> and read it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d3lPG3AEbQ">This guy </a> says it's really good.</li>
      <li>I'm unemployed at the moment and looking for writing gigs, so drop a mail to <a href="mailto:pauljoshyk96@gmail.com">pauljoshyk96@gmail.com </a> if you want any help with that.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Haha, I love talking in lists.</p>

    <h2>What else do you like talking about?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I like finding <a href="./cool-stuff-on-internet.html"> cool things on the internet. </a></li>
      <li>I'm a huge religion nerd.</li>
      <li>Clearly I'm a huge Linux nerd as well. I love Vim. Don't know what that is? I'd love to tell you all about it!</li>
      <li>I'm ADHD and autistic, so I like to talk about neurodivergence in general.</li>
      <li>Occasionally, I get interested about linguistics, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmZdGo6b5yA&list=PL96C35uN7xGLDEnHuhD7CTZES3KXFnwm0">this is all that I know</a>. And yes, 
        <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFMo3UJ4B4g">Arrival<a></i>
        was fucking amazing.</li>
      <li>I like to jam out with singers. Not a huge fan of bollywood music though. Mostly cuz I don't know the lyrics and I feel awkward.</li>
      <li>I can spend hours talking about random <a href="./youtube-theatre.html">YouTube videos</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is this site so plain?</h2>
    <p>Well, I'd like to think of this as my digital scrapbooks. And I think the best scrapbooks are unruled notebooks where you can do whatever you want. Not the kinda ones that follow a particular template. </p>

    <p>I think HTML is like the internet's paper. You can create a text file on Notepad, type out what you want to say, save it as a .html file and BAM- You have a website. Easy peasy. Somewhere along the way we forgot about that, and started depending on social media sites. </p>

    <p>This is a middle finger to all that.</p>

    <p>I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site</a> (disclaimer: Lots of swearing), but I got convinced by 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQnLsQwWdpY"> this guy</a> 
      to do better.</p>
