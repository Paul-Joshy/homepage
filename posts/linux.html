    <h1>Why Linux?</h1>
    <p>I'm starting to feel a little cocky with the HTML based writing I've been doing for the past 2 days, so I thought I'll conquer something I haven't figured how to communicate to regular folk. </p>
    <p>So, why do I use Linux?</p>
    <p>It's like that Joker meme. </p>

      <figcaption>When you use Windows or Mac, no one bats an eye. But when you use Linux, everyone loses their minds.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Now I can sit and pontificate about how Linux is great and why everyone should use it, and how Windows sucks and all that. But I know you're not going to believe me. So what's the point? </p>
    <p>So let me start from why I like Linux.</p>

    <h2>Ubuntu Nostalgia.</h2>
    <p>When I was in school, my dad hated how everyone and their grandmothers pirated Linux. And so he got himself an Ubuntu CD. And we dual booted it with our existing Windows 7. </p>
    <p>I really liked the wood panel design of the Ubuntu desktop, and wobbly windows. Wait, let me see if I can find a gif.</p>

      <figcaption>Looks fun doesn't it.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>I think one of the things that attracted me was how different it looked from Windows. Oh yeah, let me give you some backstory.</p>
    <p>So, this was around the time Windows 7 was coming out, and I really was getting into Aero theme. And there were so many other cool features. </p>

    <figure>

      <figcaption>This is what peak Windows looks like.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="windows-task-switching-animation.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>The animations are so cool.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>It looked so cool. But I hadn't gotten myself the cracked version yet. And this is around the time dad decided to put Ubuntu.</p>

    <p>So, Windows has cool features, Ubuntu has cool features. It felt like I was crushing hard on 2 different girls. Windows and Ubuntu were like Betty and Veronica to me.</p>

    <p>I quickly started to realise that you can't really do much on Ubuntu though. It wasn't really <i>restrictive</i> per say, but there were a lot of small annoyances.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The docs I open on MS Word doesn't open properly on Libre Office</li>
      <li>The programs I type on notepad gets formatted weirdly on Gedit.</li>
      <li>The fact that I can only think of 2 points is making me feel annoyed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thankfully, I had a friend who used to open the terminal, and help me fix stuff. </p>

    <h2>Windows vs Linux Customization</h2>
    <p>So I finally got around to using Windows 7, and this was the time Iron Man came out. Or I guess they used to play the movie on Star Movies and everyone wanted to make their system look like J.A.R.V.I.S. Or at least that's what was being suggested on my YouTube suggestions.</p>
