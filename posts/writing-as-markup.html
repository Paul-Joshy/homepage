      <h1>Paper for the internet.</h1>
      <!-- <p> There's this common sentiment that I keep hearing. How nothing beats writing on paper and pen. </p> -->
      <p><i>"There's no better tool for writing than pen and paper." - Ancient proverb</i></p> 
      <!-- <p>I've heard that line before.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>I think this is because the way we use digital tools have been hijacked.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>First of all, I'm sure there's an element of nostalgia that weighs in when we talk about opinions like this. But that doesn't mean we can't attempt to scientifically measure it. </p> -->

      <!-- <p>I don't know if it's nostalgia, but that that sentiment <i>feels</i> convincing. But is it true?</p> -->
      <p>I don't know if it's the nostalgia, but that that sentiment <i>feels</i> convincing. Does that make it true?</p>

      <p>So, why does paper feel like <i>paper</i>?</p>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <!-- <h3>There are no abstractions.</h3> -->
          <h3>What you see is what you get.</h3>
          <!-- <p>On paper, every scratch is recorded. If you want to make it look pretty, you'll have to physically make it look pretty. You can't just select text and change the font. Don't have a pretty handwriting? Well, too bad.</p> -->
          <p> On paper, every scratch shows. Want to make it pretty? You can't just select text, go to the fonts section and change it. You'll have to <i>write</i> it yourself. And don't even get me started on undo. </p>

          <!-- <p>Sounds terrible in the age of instant </p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- <h3>Instant feedback.</h3> -->
          <h3>You write as quick as you can write. Maybe.</h3> 
          <!-- <p>Lagging is a digital construct. When it comes to the physical world, every action is reliable. Including the errors. Or in the words of master Oogway</p> -->
          <!-- <p> No I didn't say the same thing twice. I meant, it's intentional. At least when it comes to a rough draft. </p> -->
          <!-- <p>If you're scribbling along, and if you </p> -->

          <!-- <p> So when you write on Google Docs, or Microsoft word, or whatever they use these days, you type a word, and then...<i>you wait</i>. </p> -->
          <!-- <p>Okay, so this maybe because my computer that came out during the stone age. Most modern computers don't lag. But that's the point.</p> -->
          <p> No, that's not a typo. The cursor just doesn't move as quickly as I type.</p>


          <p>Okay, so this could be because I use a computer that came out during the stone age. Most modern computers don't lag. Why is that? Maybe it could be because...</p>

          <!-- <p>But when it comes to digital tools, accidents are frowned upon. Everything needs to be "pixel perfect", as they say it. And we all know how conducive such an environment is to creative expression </p> -->

        <li>
          <h3>Paper is more reliable...<i>and cheap.</i></h3>
          <!-- <p>Right now, I accidentally used the wrong headline format, and I was preoccupied with making that change instead of focusing on my writing. When it comes to writing on paper, mistakes have consequences. But also, mistakes give art character. But in the digital space, y u don't make mistakes. You make errors.</p> -->
          <p>That's right. Your old Pentium Dual Core laptop
            isn't going to write your essay on Google Docs without having a meltdown. But that stack of paper you bought to write love letters to your first girlfriend? <i> I know, it looks a
              little yellow but...</i> it's still good enough for your
            first draft. </p>
          <p>Want a fresh stack? Just walk to
            your nearest stationery store and hand out your
            spare pennies. </p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's things like that gives paper that edge.</p>

      <h2>So, are digital tools <i>actually</i> that bad?</h2>

      <p>Okay, so I know I sound like a boomer for saying this, <i>but for some goshdarn reason</i> words flow out of my hand when I use a piece of paper compared to when I use google docs. </p>

      <!-- But if I were a zoomer, maybe I wouldn't feel this sense of nostalgia. I certainly don't remember feeling this way about paper and pen when I was in school, and wrote all the time.</p> -->

      <p>But that's because I grew up with pen and paper. My future kids would have the same practial sensibilities for using pen and paper as I do for hieroglyphics.</p>

        <p>When I started my writing career, I had so much writer's block, I couldn't breathe. And it was pretty ironic too, as I used to write without thinking when I wasn't paid to do it. </P

        <p> That's when I realised something. My DMs were
          <i> waay </i> more creative than the stuff I could ever write on
          Google Docs. </p>

        <p>Does that mean WhatsApp is the most superior form of writing? Probably not. It was just something that <i>I'm comfortable with.</i></p>

        <!-- <p>But wait. What if were were the prodigal cavemen all along?</p> -->

        <!-- I couldn't write the way I used to do when I didn't write for money. I used to be a wordplay master. I could think of lines on the spot. But now that I'm writing for money, none of the words would come out.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>It was awful till I found a hack. I started DM'ing myself on my phone instead of using Google Docs. The DM's felt like a more familiar outlet, a place where I fool around with my friends and have fun. And that was the secret ingredient after all. But that didn't last long. Because.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>Here's something equally annoying.</p> -->

        <h2>The two modes of writing.</h2>

        <p>When I'm writing something. I usually am not
          thinking about the words I type. Instead, my brain goes like this:</p>

      <ul>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
        <span>That's a weird way to phrase things</span>
      </ul>

        <!-- <p>Over and over till I get overwhelmed and end up deleting everything.</p> -->

      <!-- <p>I type a word, i press backspace. I type a word, I press backspace. The lop. </p> -->

        <p>I know this happens to you too. Don't lie. So, how do we <i>fix this?</i></p>

        <p>One way is to reframe your mindset. You're either
        <i>writing</i> or you're <i>editing</i>. Don't edit
        while you write. Let the mistakes happen. Once you're
        done writing, you can resume being the world's worst
        critic.</p>

        <p>And that's easier said than done on a computer. There's nothing more tempting than pressing that backspace key to do a quick edit. But on paper, you can't. Mistakes are mistakes. And you have the luxury of letting them be, till you correct them on your next draft.</p>

        <h2>HTML as the rough draft.</h2>

        <p>This is how I write.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/vim-example.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>That's right. I'm using HTML. And for good reason.</figcaption> 
        </figure>

        <p>Look at the preview on the left. It's so pretty, isn't it? Definitely better than the ugly HTML code on the right. With all the weird colours and symbols and letters that get cut off in between. You know what that reminds me of?</p>

        <p>A first draft. On paper.</p>

        <p>That's right. It's messy. Just like your terrible
          handwriting on paper. Because you can make mistakes freely if the output looks this ugly. And that's what makes it 
          <i> beautiful. </i></p>

        <p>But unlike writing your drafts on paper, you don't have to rewrite anything! You can marvel at your final draft in its pixel perfect glory whenever you want. But every time you write, you get to do it on your unpolished draft that won't intimidate you. </p>

        <!-- <p>Okay, so maybe HTML is a little intimidating, but trust me. Once you get the hang of it, it'll start feeling like paper again.</p> -->

        <p>And that's why I think HTML is like paper, but for the internet.</p>
