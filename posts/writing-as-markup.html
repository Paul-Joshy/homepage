    <h1>Rethinking the way we write, with HTML.</h1>
    <!-- <p> There's this common sentiment that I keep hearing. How nothing beats writing on paper and pen. </p> -->
    <p>Nothing beats writing on paper. I've heard that before.</p>
    <!-- <p>I think this is because the way we use digital tools have been hijacked.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>First of all, I'm sure there's an element of nostalgia that weighs in when we talk about opinions like this. But that doesn't mean we can't attempt to scientifically measure it. </p> -->

    <!-- <p>I don't know if it's nostalgia, but that that sentiment <i>feels</i> convincing. But is it true?</p> -->
    <p>I don't know if it's nostalgia, but that that sentiment <i>feels</i> convincing. Does that make it true?</p>

      <hl><h2><i>Is</i> writing on paper better?</h2></hl>
      <li>
        <!-- <h3>There are no abstractions.</h3> -->
        <h3>What you see <i>is</i> what you get.</h3>
        <!-- <p>On paper, every scratch is recorded. If you want to make it look pretty, you'll have to physically make it look pretty. You can't just select text and change the font. Don't have a pretty handwriting? Well, too bad.</p> -->
        <p> On paper, every scratch shows. Want to make it pretty? You can't just select text, go to the fonts section and change it. You'll have to <i>write</i> it yourself. And don't even get me started on undo. </p>

        <!-- <h3>Instant feedback.</h3> -->
        <h3>You write as quick as you can write. Maybe.</h3> 
        <!-- <p>Lagging is a digital construct. When it comes to the physical world, every action is reliable. Including the errors. Or in the words of master Oogway</p> -->
        <!-- <p> No I didn't say the same thing twice. I meant, it's intentional. At least when it comes to a rough draft. </p> -->
        <!-- <p>If you're scribbling along, and if you </p> -->

        <!-- <p> So when you write on Google Docs, or Microsoft word, or whatever they use these days, you type a word, and then...<i>you wait</i>. </p> -->

        <!-- <p>But when it comes to digital tools, accidents are frowned upon. Everything needs to be "pixel perfect", as they say it. And we all know how conducive such an environment is to creative expression </p> -->

        <h3>Paper is more reliable...<i>and cheap.</i></h3>
        <!-- <p>Right now, I accidentally used the wrong headline format, and I was preoccupied with making that change instead of focusing on my writing. When it comes to writing on paper, mistakes have consequences. But also, mistakes give art character. But in the digital space, y u don't make mistakes. You make errors.</p> -->
        <p>That's right. Computers age. Your old pentium
          laptop running Windows 98 won't open
          Microsoft Word 2025 and type out your document without
          complaining. But that stack of paper you bought
          right after your first breakup? <i> Well it's a
            little yellow</i> but it's still fine for your
          first draft. Want a stack of new sheets? All you
          have to do is go down the road, and hand over your
          spare change. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>See where I'm getting at?</p>

    <h2>So, are digital tools <i>actually</i> that bad?</h2>

    <p>Okay, so I know I sound like a boomer <i>but for some goshdarn reason</i> words flow out of my hand when I use a piece of paper compared to when I use google docs. </p>

      <!-- But if I were a zoomer, maybe I wouldn't feel this sense of nostalgia. I certainly don't remember feeling this way about paper and pen when I was in school, and wrote all the time.</p> -->

    <p>But that's because I grew up with pen and paper. My future kids would have the same reverence for penmanship as an artform, as I do for cave paintings.</p>

      <p>When I started my writing career, I had so much writer's block, I couldn't breathe. And it was pretty ironic too, as I used to write without thinking when I wasn't paid to do it. </P

      <p> That's when I realised something. My DMs were
        <i> waay </i> more creative than the stuff I wrote on
        Google Docs. </p>

      <p>Does that mean WhatsApp is the most superior form of writing? Of course not. It was just something that I'm comfortable with.</p>

      <p>But wait. What if were were the prodigal cavemen all along?</p>

        <!-- I couldn't write the way I used to do when I didn't write for money. I used to be a wordplay master. I could think of lines on the spot. But now that I'm writing for money, none of the words would come out.</p> -->

      <!-- <p>It was awful till I found a hack. I started DM'ing myself on my phone instead of using Google Docs. The DM's felt like a more familiar outlet, a place where I fool around with my friends and have fun. And that was the secret ingredient after all. But that didn't last long. Because.</p> -->

      <h2>The limitations of writing.</h2>
      <p>We think of writing as an established art form. But that doesn't mean it's perfect. And I'm going to use a nerdy analogy to explain my point.</p>
      <p>In Linux (Well, Unix based Operating Systems, sue me), you can pause a program by pressing Ctrl-Z. I don't mean stop. I mean <i>pause</i>. And to resume, I can type fg (short for foreground). Let me Illustrate it with an example.</p>

      <p>Right now I'm editing the html for this on Vim. The cursor is on line number 95 and right here</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../images/vim-example.png" caption="It's right next to the right here" alt="">
        <figcaption>See the block of text that's selected? That's what I'm editing.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Us humans cannot do this. We can't just freeze our synapses. If we figure how to freeze time, maybe. The applications for such a possibility is far too big for me to indulge right now, but let's just consider what that can do to writing.</p>

      <p>Now if I press the shortcut for pause, the entire program pauses. And I don't mean exit. I mean <i>pause</i>. Once I'm done doing other things on the computer, I can resume, and the cursor will be waiting for me on the same line, just the way I left it. </p>

      <p>What if we could do this while writing? Pause and resume in the exact same mood as we left it? Or better yet, go back to the mood where I didn't have writers block?</p>

      <p>That would be sick.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the universe isn't that generous. Here's something equally annoying.</p>

      <h2>Writing mode, and editing mode.</h2>

      <p>Usually, when I'm writing something, there are far more things that go on my head other than just the words I type. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Did I use the right word?</li>
        <li>Is there a way I can make this phrase better? </li>
        <li>How does this contribute to the overall narrative? </li>
      </ul>

      <p>So many things. How to make it stop?</p>

      <p>One way is to reframe your mindset. You're either <i>writing</i> or you're <i>editing</i>. Don't edit while you write. Let the mistakes happen. Once you're done writing, you can resume being your worst critic.</p>

      <p>Easier said than done on a computer. There's nothing more tempting than pressing that backspace key to do a quick edit. But on paper, you can't. Mistakes are mistakes. And you have the luxury of letting them be, till you correct them on the next draft.</p>

      <h2>HTML as the rough draft.</h2>

      <p>Let's look at that image again.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../images/vim-example.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Why does HTML have to look so ugly?</figcaption> 
      </figure>

      <p>Look at the preview on the left, it's so pretty, isn't it? Definitely compared to the ugly HTML code on the left. With all the weird colours and symbols and letters that get cut off in between. You know what that reminds me of?</p>

      <p>A first draft. On paper.</p>

      <p>That's right. It's messy. Just like your terrible
        handwriting on your first paper draft. Because you can make mistakes freeely when the output looks this ugly. And that's why it's
        <i> beautiful. </i></p>

      <p>And that's why HTML is like paper, for the internet.</p>
