    <h1> HTML - The paper of the internet. </h1>
    <p> There's this common sentiment that I keep hearing. How nothing beats writing on paper and pen. </p>
    <!-- <p>I think this is because the way we use digital tools have been hijacked.</p> -->
    <p>First of all, I'm sure there's an element of nostalgia that weighs in when we talk about opinions like this. But that doesn't mean we can't attempt to scientifically measure it. </p>

    <ul>
      <hl><h2>Why is writing on paper better?</h2></hl>
      <li>
        <h3>There are no abstractions.</h3>
        <p>Every scratch you make with your writing instrument of choice, it's reflected on paper. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Instant feedback.</h3>
        <p>Lagging is a digital construct. When it comes to the physical world, every action is reliable. Including the errors. Or in the words of master Oogway</p>

        <img src="master-oogway" caption="There are no accidents" alt="">

        <p>But when it comes to digital tools, accidents are frowned upon. Everything needs to be "pixel perfect", as they say it. And we all know how conducive such an environment is to creative expression </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Aesthetics are given more value.</h3>
        <p>Right now, I accidentally used the wrong headline format, and I was preoccupied with making that change instead of focusing on my writing. When it comes to writing on paper, mistakes have consequences. But also, mistakes give art character. But in the digital space, you don't make mistakes. You make errors.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not an exhaustive list. But I think this can <i>start the ball rolling.</i></p>

    <h2>Are digital tools actually that bad?</h2>
    <p>This is a very boomer problem in the first place. I get it. I hate using Substack too. Words flow out of my hand when I use a piece of paper compared to when I use google docs. But if I were a zoomer, maybe I wouldn't feel this sense of nostalgia. I certainly don't remember feeling this way about paper and pen when I was in school, and wrote all the time.</p>

    <p><small>There's also a high chance that this is not as much of a prevailant thought as I might think</small></p>

      <p>When I started off my writing career, I couldn't write like how I used to do for some reasons. I used to be a wordplay master. I could think of lines on the spot. But now that I'm writing for money, none of the words would come out.</p>

      <p>It was awful till I found a hack. I started DM'ing myself on my phone instead of using Google Docs. The DM's felt like a more familiar outlet, a place where I fool around with my friends and have fun. And that was the secret ingredient after all. But that didn't last long. Because.</p>

      <h2>The limitations of writing.</h2>
      <p>We think of writing as an established art form. But I think there's an aspect to it that we haven't tapped into.</p>
      <p>In unix, you can pause a program by pressing Ctrl-Z. I don't mean stop. I mean <i>pause</i>. And to resume, I can type fg (short for foreground). Let me Illustrate it with an example.</p>

      <p>Right now I'm typing this on Vim. The cursor is on line number 51 and right here</p>

      <img src="vim-screenshot.png" caption="It's right next to the right here" alt="">

      <p>If I press Ctrl-Z this whole action is paused. When I press fg, it will open with the cursor right there.</p>
      <p>Us humans cannot do this. We can't just freeze our synapses. If we figure how to freeze time, maybe. The applications for such a possibility is far too big for me to indulge right now, but let's just consider what that can do to writing.</p>

      <p>Right now as I was typing this, some family drama interrupted me, and I lost the mood. I can't go back to the moment where I had the mood to write. But what if we could?</p>

      <h2>Writing mode, and editing mode.</h2>
      <p>Usually, when I'm writing something, there are far more things that go on my head other than just the words I type. Did I use the right word? Is there a way I can make this phrase better? How does this contribute to the overall narrative? So many things. </p>

      <p>The usual solution to all this is to split your writing process into 2 processess.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing mode, and </li>
        <li>Editing mode.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>During writing mode, you just keep pouring down your word vomit down the page, and ignore all thoughts of beautifing it. That part comes later, when you're in editing mode, where you're you're own worst ctritic. </p>

      <p>I'm thinking there's a way to combine both of them.</p>

      <h2>Rough draft. Vs. Final writeup.</h2>
      <p>If we have 2 modes of writing, why can't we have tools that works with this behavior? Well, you do. It's called a markup language.</p>

      <p>Right now, I'm writing html, a markup language.</p>
      <img src="html-example" caption="The state of my draft right now" alt="">

      <p>Look at it. It's ugly. Weirdly spaced. Weird symbols. Letters are getting cut out. But wait- It kinda looks like something else.</p>
      <p>A rough draft. With all the scratches, and weird margins, and wayward lines.</p>
      <p>That's why I think HTML <i>feels</i> like paper.</p>
