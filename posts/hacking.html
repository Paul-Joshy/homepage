    <h1>What's with all the hacker hate?</h1>
    <p>No. Just no. Fuck you.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to hack your stupid Instagram account.</p>
    <p>Do I know how how to hack it? Sure. Theoretically, at least. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9dBGWVwMMA">Here's how.</a></p>
    <p>It's a skill, just like crochet or basketball. A <i>neutral</i> one. So don't get your panties in a twist. </p>

    <p>Skills are neutral in general. It's how you <i>use them</i> that matters.</p>

    <p>I know how to use a knife as well. That doesn't mean I'm going to go around stabbing people.</p>
    
    <p><strong>So, why don't you call something more noble and respectable? Like a cybersecurity professional?</strong></p>

    <p>Because I would be lying. You need to be doing this professionally to be callled that. I don't tweak my Linux config because someone pays me to. I do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St8iEpkcDJc">because it's fun!</a> God forbid a grown ass man do something for fun. It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">philosophy</a> as well.</p>

    <p><strong>Wait wait hold up. Isn't hacking what bad people do?</strong></p>

    <p>Look at you jumping to conclusions before knowing what the term even means.</p>

    <p>Okay, so I haven't byhearted the definition like it's my goddamn 10th standard board exams. But let me take a crack at it.</p>
    <!-- <p>Let's define what hacking is, first.</p> -->
    <p><i>A hacker is someone who gets joy from using a system or a tool in a way that it wasn't intended to. </i></p>

    <p>That's it. And that includes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You rooting your android device</li>
      <li>Pirating movies, softwares through torrents.</li>
      <li>Generally tinkering around on your system and make it exactly the way you want.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Do you think you deserve to be arrested for that you entitled fuck? Why are you so afraid of freedom?</p> 

    <p>Yeah sure, it also includes stealing your nudes, you perv. But that doesn't mean all hackers are like that. You know why? Because there's this thing called <i>morals</i>. Heard of it? It's this voice in your head that tells you when you're doing something shady. Here's what its not.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The law</li>
      <li>Other people's opinions of what's right and wrong.</li>
      <li>What society thinks it's right for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yeah, that's right. You can be a good person and still go against society. Heck, I'd even argue that's the right way of doing things. And if you don't want to do it because it's not practical, that's fine too. Because <i>guess what?</i> It's none of my goddamn business to tell you how to live your life. I just want you to extend that same respect back.</p>

    <p>Why is that so fucking hard?</p>
