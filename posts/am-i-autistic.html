    <h1>Am I autistic?</h1>
    <p>Dear Kina,</p>

    <p>I hope this helps you thorugh these testing times.</p>

    <!-- <p>I'm writing this while you're questioning whether you're autistic. Because I want to help</p> -->

    <p>First of all, I want to tell you that this is not <small>just</small> because I feel partly responsible. You know how hard it is to strike a conversation about autism with most people? It's close to impossible. And I'm super excited that you're into this topic. Which comes to my first point as to why I think you may be actually autistic.</p>

    <h2>You're interested.</h2>
    <p>As a person who tries to get people excited about topics that I'm into, most people aren't really <i>interested</i> about stuff. At most they might entertain the conversation, but they never contribute to it as much as I want them too.</p>

    <p>Let me be very clear though. I don't think you're
      interested in <i>everything</i>. Like the other topics I try to talk to you about. </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Harry Potter</li>
      <li>Linux stuff.</li>
      <li>Religion</li>
      <li>Philosophy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And you don't give a shit. <small> okay maybe not Harry
      Potter, but the point is that</small> You do this
      because <i>you follow your curiosity.</i></p>


    <p>Kinda like Sherlock Holmes.</p>

    <h2>That's right. You're like Sherlock Holmes.</h2>
    <p>No, I don't mean you're a super genius <small> but you never know</small>. I'm talking about the rest of his personality.</p>
    <p>Sherly has a unique way of viewing the world.
      And no, I'm not trying to speak in platitudes. There really is something <i>special</i> about him. </p>

    <p>Like the things he's interested in, for starters.</p>

    <!-- <p>Apologies in advance cuz I'm going to refer to the American RDJ interpretation, but I'll try to examples from the little I know about his character portrayed in books.</p> -->

    <h3>He has special interests.</h3>
    <p>There's a scene in the RDJ Sherlock Holmes movie
      <small>I know you hate it but bear with me</small>
      where Watson finds him training flies to move around
      the jar in concentric circles. This is played for
      laughs because for a neurotypical person...</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is not financially viable.</li>
      <li>This is not going to improve your social life.</li>
      <li>It's not useful in any conceivable way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's like, they can't grasp the concept of having interests because you <i>like</i> them.</p>

    <p>Most of the people I know follow this <i>template</i> of thinking. You don't. It's kinda ironic though, cuz autistic people are known to templatize the rest of their lives, but when it comes to hobbies and interests&mdash;The more chaotic, the better. You know why? </p>
    <i>Because they follow their own curiosity.</i></p>

    <p>But that can make him stubborn about his interests as well.</p>

    <h3>He's a stubborn bitch.</h3>

    <p>In <i>A Study In Scarlet</i>, Watson does an analysis of Holmes.</p>

    <p>One quick glance and you'll see how deficient he is
      when it comes to general knowledge. There's even that famous scene where he
      doesn't know or care that the earth revolves around
      the sun because it's not releant to his work. I secretly think he's just making excuses so Conan Doyle won't be forced to say <i>I only want to learn the things I want to learn</i>. </p

    <p>Here's another story that makes me sure Sherlock doesn't care about the cosmos one bit.</p>

    <blockquote cite="Sherlock Holmes Tent Story">
      <p><i>Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go on a camping trip, set up their tent, and fall asleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes his faithful friend. "Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see." Watson replies, "I see millions of stars." "What does that tell you?" Watson ponders for a minute. "Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo. Timewise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you?" Holmes is silent for a moment, then speaks. "Watson, you idiot, someone has stolen our tent."</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I don't know if this is apographical, but it fits the archetype perfectly.
      That's because <strong>Sherlock isn't curious about the things he's not curious about. </p>

    <p>See the similarities? No? Maybe it's because of your...</p>

    <!-- <h2>He has his own way of doing things.</h2> -->

    <h2>Impostor Syndrome</h2>
    <p>I think this is what you're struggling with the most. And I think the disability community has to be blamed for some of it.</p>

    <p>There's this thing, where people like us get mad when
      someone says, <i>"Omg I'm so OCD"</i> or something
      similar. I understand the sentiment, but I think that
      makes it hard for newcomers to say their piece without
      overthinking about offending them.</p>

    <p>But that also works like a good check to prove your authenticity.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>People who deeply <i>feel</i> autistic tend to be more considerate about the feelings of the community.</li>
      <li>People who are just interested in the <i>aesthetics</i> of autism tend to miss out on these finer details.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So if you have impostor syndrome, then something about
      this resonates with you more than the way regular
      people relate to it. Kinda like the enchantment used by Dumbledore on the Sorcerer's Stone.</p>

    <p><i>"Only someone who wanted to find the stone&mdash;but
      not use it&mdash;could recieve it."</i></p>

    <h2>An alternate approach.</h2>

    <p>At the end of the day, I'm no therapist. And you're questioning too, so it's harder to explain your position to people. Here's what you can say instead.</p>

    <blockquote cite="A Midsummer Night's Dream">
      <p><i>If we shadows have offended,</i></p>
      <p><i>Think but this, and all is mended&mdash;</i></p>
      <p><i>I speak no claim with boast or plea,</i></p>
      <p><i>But only share what seems to be.</i></p>
      <p><i>If I say, “I think I'm autistic,”</i></p>
      <p><i>Let not thy heart turn chauvinistic.</i></p>
      <p><i>No harm I mean, no crown I seek,</i></p>
      <p><i>Just naming thoughts I cannot keep.</i></p>
      <p><i>For wonder grows where doubt is cast,</i></p>
      <p><i>And self-discovery comes at last.</i></p>
      <p><i>So judge me not for what I feel,</i></p>
      <p><i>This thought of mine is just as real.</i></p>
      <p><i>And if this notion gives offense,</i></p>
      <p><i>Then take it as no more than sense.</i></p>
      <p><i>Give me your hand, if we be friends,</i></p>
      <p><i>And Puck shall make amends.</i></p>
