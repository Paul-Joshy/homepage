    <h1>My favourite razors, idioms, sieves, and the like.</h1>

    <p><i><q>Of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.</q></i> <br>&mdash; Occam's razor</p>

    <p><i><q>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</q></i> <br>&mdash; Hanlon's razor</p>

    <p><i><q>What can be claimed without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence, </q></i> <br>&mdash; Hitchen's razor</p>

    <p><i><q>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</q></i> <br>&mdash; Carl Sagan</p>

    <p><i><q>When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth</q></i> <br>&mdash; Sherlock Holmes (Abductive Reasoning)</p>
