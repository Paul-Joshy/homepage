    <h1>List of my favourite quotes</h1>

    <p><i>There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio, than are dreamt up in your philosophy</i> <br>&mdash; Hamlet, Act 1 Scene V</p>

    <p><i>The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes</i> <br> &mdash; Sherlock Holmes, Hound of the Baskervilles</p>

    <p><i>â€œYou see? There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant...Oh, fuck it.</i> <br> &mdash; M. Gustave, The Grand Budapest Hotel </p>
